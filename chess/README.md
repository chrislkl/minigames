HOW TO PLAY

run ./chess in a terminal

This assumes the user knows the basic rules of chess.

To start, enter "game player player" to begin a chess match between 2 human players.
You may change "player" to "computer#" where # is a number between 1 and 4, which corresponds to the computer level.
Example: "game player computer2" is a game between you and a level 2 computer.

Once the game board appears, enter "move [start position] [end position]" to move a piece
Example: "move b2 b3" will move a piece from b2 to b3.

Enter "resign" to end the game prematurely.
